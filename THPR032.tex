\begin{abstract}
   Testing of space-bound microelectronics plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability of electronics exposed to the challenging radiation environment of outer space. This contribution describes the beam optics studies carried out for the run held in November 2023 in the context of the CERN High-Energy Accelerators for Radiation Testing and Shielding (HEARTS) experiment. It also delves into an investigation of the initial conditions at the start of the transfer line from the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) to the CERN High Energy Accelerator Mixed-field (CHARM) facility. Comprehensive optics measurement and simulation campaigns were carried out for this purpose and are presented here. Using a validated optics model of the transfer line, the impact of air scattering on the beam size was quantified with MAD-X and FLUKA, providing valuable insights into the current performance and limitations for Single Event Effects (SEE) testing at CHARM.

\section{OPTICS MODEL}

CERN High-Energy Accelerators for Radiation Testing and Shielding (HEARTS) \cite{noauthor_hearts_nodate} use slow-extracted beams from CERN's Proton Synchrotron (PS) to irradiate electronics at the CERN High Energy Accelerator Mixed-field (CHARM) facility. Accurate beam modeling is essential for precisely predicting beam sizes on Devices Under Test (DUTs), ensuring the reliability of radiation effects testing. This section discusses the detailed beam optics measurements undertaken using a lead ion beam with a kinetic energy of \SI{2}{\giga\electronvolt\per\nucleon}, aimed at refining the optics model. 

\subsection{Quadrupole Scan Measurement}

During Machine Development (MD) studies, quadrupole scans on the PS to East Dump transfer line (F61D) established initial beam conditions post-extraction, capturing the non-linear behavior of the PS main units' edge fields. The empirical modeling approach has been shown to be more reliable than a stitched model \cite{johnson_beam_2022}. The transfer line includes three quadrupoles and a Beam Television (BTV) equipped with a fluorescent screen for beam size measurements. The scans were conducted at the upper energy limits provided by HEARTS to mitigate the impact of beam-material (air, instrumentation, vacuum window) interaction. Py-BOBYQA \cite{cartis_escaping_2022, cartis_improving_2019} was chosen as the optimization algorithm to minimize the sum of squared differences between the simulated and measured beam sizes. It was used to determine a set of initial Twiss parameters and normalized emittances, while keeping the dispersion constant. Additionally, kick response measurements validated the beam optics model, giving confidence in the model's representation of the transfer line.



\subsection{Dispersion Measurement}

In a second MD, the dispersion was measured in the T8 transfer line at two different BTV locations (T08.BTV020, T08.BTV035) and at the Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber (MWPC) located at the end of the line (T08.MWPC). The momentum of the beam was changed by modifying the revolution frequency $f_{\text{rev}}$ before extraction (before the RF is turned off and the beam debunched), followed by measuring the resulting centroid movement. Dispersion is given by:

\begin{equation}
D = \frac{\Delta x}{\frac{\Delta p}{p}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta x$ is the change in the centroid position, and $\frac{\Delta p}{p}$ is the relative change in the beam's momentum. The change in $f_{\text{rev}}$ and the relative change in beam momentum can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta f_{\text{rev}}}{f_{\text{rev}}} = -\eta \frac{\Delta p}{p}
\end{equation}

\noindent where, $\eta$ is the slip factor, defined as:

\begin{equation}
\eta = \left(\frac{1}{\gamma_{\text{tr}}^{2}} - \frac{1}{\gamma^{2}}\right)
\end{equation}

\noindent and $\gamma = 11.41$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor, and $\gamma_{\text{tr}} = 6.13$ is the transition gamma, both determined using a MAD-X \cite{noauthor_mad_nodate} model of the PS. The dispersion is calculated from the slopes of the measured changes in centroid position versus the relative change in momentum, corrected by the factor of $\frac{1}{\eta f_{\text{rev}_0}}$ where the initial revolution frequency, $f_{\text{rev}_0}$, is $452.0$ kHz and presented in Table \ref{tab:dispersion}. A caveat of this measurement is that it was performed for only the nominal quadrupole settings. A more rigorous method would have involved adjusting $f_{\text{rev}}$ for each change of optics as the quadrupole strengths were scanned.

A match of the dispersion at the start of the F61 line was done using these measurements, and the optimizer was once again run on the Twiss parameters as they collectively influence the beam size. The new set of initial conditions (including the new fixed dispersion) is presented in Table \ref{tab:initial_conditions_comparison}.

%%%% AIR SCATTERING %%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Air scattering}


From the PS extraction to the DUT, the beam travels through interceptive instrumentation devices and regions or air/windows, during which the emittance increases and the beam energy straggles due to matter interaction. Primary effects, such as an increase in beam size, required developing a custom multiple Coulomb scattering module\footnote{An example is available in the \href{https://gitlab.cern.ch/abt-optics-and-code-repository/simulation-codes/pybt/-/blob/master/pybt/examples/example_air_scattering.ipynb}{PyBT GitLab repository}.} to simulate these changes, compensating for MAD-X's lack of beam-matter interaction modeling. The increase in divergence, $\theta_{rms}$, for an ensemble of particles undergoing multiple Coulomb scattering as it passes through a medium is expressed as \cite{muller_description_2001}:

\[
\theta_{rms} = \frac{\SI{13.6}{\mega\electronvolt\per\speedoflight}}{p\beta_{p}}q_{p}\sqrt\frac{L}{L_{rad}}
\]

\noindent where $p$ is the beam's total energy in \SI{}{\mega\electronvolt}, $q_{p}$ the number of charges, $L$ is the length of the interaction and $L_{\text{rad}}$ is:

\[
L_{\text{rad}} = \frac{L_{\text{rad0}}}{\frac{P_{\text{Torr}}}{760}}
\]

\noindent where $P=\SI{1.013}{\bar}$ is the standard air pressure, and $P_{\text{Torr}} = 750.062\cdot P$. The radiation length for air, $L_{\text{rad0}}=\SI{301}{}$\footnote{\href{https://cds.cern.ch/record/941314/files/p245.pdf}{{https://cds.cern.ch/record/941314/files/p245.pdf}}}. The Twiss parameters and emittance evolve from before (0) and after (1) an air region of length L as,


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mc_eq}
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{1} &= \frac{\varepsilon_0 \alpha_0 - \frac{L}{2} \theta_{\text{rms}}^2}{\varepsilon_0 + \Delta \varepsilon}\\
\beta_{1} &= \frac{\varepsilon_0 \beta_0 + \frac{L^2}{3} \theta_{\text{rms}}^2}{\varepsilon_0 + \Delta \varepsilon}\\
\varepsilon_{1} &= \varepsilon_0 + \frac{1}{2} \theta_{\text{rms}}^2 \left( \beta_0 + L \alpha_0 + \frac{L^2}{3} \gamma_0 \right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The modular design of the code allows for effective handling of multiple Coulomb interactions in any MAD-X sequence. After loading the MAD-X sequence, the user introduces air regions along the sequence with a specified integration length $L$ in meters. The process\_scattering() function calculates the impact of the MCS on the beam parameters, generating an updated Twiss output. Upon reaching the "AIR\_START" marker, the function records the beta functions using "SAVEBETA" and segments the beam line at this point. It then performs a Twiss calculation with the saved values, updating $\alpha, \beta$ and $\varepsilon$ following Eq.~\eqref{eq:mc_eq}. This procedure is repeated at each "INNER\_MARKER," refining the beam optics iteratively to account for multiple Coulomb scattering effects in air regions.

   \caption{Semi-analytical simulation of multiple Coulomb scattering using a sample lattice.}
   \label{fig:simple_line}
\end{figure}

Semi-analytical results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations that applied random transverse displacements to particle trajectories, simulating scattering with a Gaussian-distributed angle $\theta_{RMS}$. This process emulated the randomness of actual scattering, generating a variety of particle paths to compare statistical beam properties between both methods. Table~\ref{tab:sigma_comparison} contrasts these simulation approaches, noting that while the Monte Carlo method requires 30 minutes for 50,000 particles, the analytical method takes only 1-2 seconds, regardless of the particle count.

The current HEARTS installation is limited due to extensive air regions along the beam path as it passes through the IRRAD zone to CHARM. One straightforward improvement would be to shift the irradiation from CHARM to IRRAD, which is located just a few meters upstream, minimizing the air seen by the beam before arriving at the DUT.

%%%% ENERGY CONTROL %%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Energy control}

Variation of the ion beam’s energy is essential for exploring large parameter space of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) and penetration depth and were developed by CHIMERA at CERN. This involves adjusting the magnetic field at the PS's flat top to change beam rigidity. A makerule algorithm recalculates the magnetic field necessary for transfer line magnets. Removing Pole Face Windings (PFW), which are used to control the tune in the PS and do not scale linearly with rigidity, ensures smooth energy variations. In 2023, the use of distinct cycles for each energy was replaced by a single cycle managed by a Python script that can be quickly trimmed to seamlessly transition between \SI{650}{} and \SI{2000}{\mega\electronvolt\per\nucleon} executing changes every \SI{15}-\SI{30}{\second}. The cycle also supports energy scans that determine the beam's kinetic energy using penetration tests in materials like PolyMethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and speeds up Single Event Effects (SEE) testing of components \cite{noauthor_hearts_nodate}. Additionally, Python scripting provides control over fluence, which is vital for accurate radiation effect testing. A script ensures that the beam is disabled once the target total ion count impacting the DUT is achieved, with fluence measured by the calibrated XSEC070.

\subsection{Straggling Effects}
Energy straggling affects the beam's rigidity as it traverses air regions in the F61 and T08 transfer lines. This effect, which was simulated by FLUKA including vacuum windows, air and beam instrumentation \cite{battistoni_overview_2015} was measured by observing the moving transverse position in a dispersive region in the transfer line. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:straggling_effects}, at T08.BTV35, the lower kinetic energy at extraction leads to a more significant beam displacement, confirming FLUKA's predictions. Installing vacuum chambers, particularly in key areas such as the F61.MBXHD025 switching dipole of F61, is recommended to reduce air-induced straggling. This would optimize VHE ion irradiation at IRRAD/CHARM by improving beam transport.

%%%% COMPARISON MEAS AND SIM %%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Comparison of measurement to simulation}
% This section presents a comparison between the measured beam optics at various points along the transfer line and the predictions made by our MCS-enhanced simulation model.

% Optics measurements were performed using the Beam Television (BTV) monitors along the transfer line. These measurements include profiles at various beam energies, extracted using the slow-extraction process from the CERN PS. Simultaneously, an enhanced model incorporating MCS effects was developed using the MAD-X simulation tool, adjusted to account for the scattering parameters calculated using the following MCS code discussed previously.

% \subsection{Results and Discussion}
% The results from the BTV measurements and MAD-X simulations are compiled in Table \ref{tab:optics_comparison}. The table lists the measured and simulated beam sizes, showing both the horizontal and vertical measurements across different stations.

%\subsection{Comparison with MWPC}


Figure~\ref{fig:diff_beam_size} compares the measured and simulated horizontal (H) and vertical (V) beam sizes at the MWPC as a function of quadrupole strengths, highlighting that the vertical beam measurements exhibit increased errors due to interactions with the vacuum pipe aperture, which alters its Gaussian shape. The aperture scraping may occur due to the varying dipolar moment experienced during quadrupole scans, as the beam does not travel through the center of the quadrupoles. This comparison validates the accuracy of the simulations used for SEE testing at CHARM.

\section{CONCLUSION}

This study has advanced the beam optics modeling for radiation effects testing with slow-extracted VHE heavy ions from the PS. Key advancements include the refined measurement of initial conditions, the characterization of the dispersion, and the modeling of air scattering through multiple Coulomb scattering. Note that the current air modeling excludes elastic and inelastic interactions. The validated beam model significantly improves the precision and reliability of radiation testing setups. Future improvements will focus on moving HEARTS from CHARM to IRRAD and an additional vacuum section to minimize air interactions will further refine beam control and homogeneity. These contributions not only enhance the robustness of radiation testing at CERN, but also provide valuable insights for similar facilities globally.
