	abstract = {Perturbation of a beam by an obstacle in the beam patch is a well-known problem. Monitoring devices to determine beam parameters or stripping foils to change the charge state of ions are placed in the beam path and cause energy loss and scattering processes. This note describes these processes in the framework of covariance matrices, which makes no a priori assumption of the actual phase space distribution and is applicable to a variety of processes involving changes in particle position and angle. Exact compact expressions are derived whose series expansions yield the usual approximate expressions for increase in beam emittance and change in Twiss parrameters. A numerical example is given fo the case of scattering and compared with results derived from a corresponding Monte Carlo calculation.},

	abstract = {The NIMMS (Next Ion Medical Machine Study) Group is designing an accelerator for medical applications that needs to extract a uniform spill of particles to the tumor. This is performed by slow extraction via the RF-KO (radio-frequency knock-out) method. The target of this project was to create a feedback system that can control this beam extraction. It is one of the first approaches to create a feedback system in simulation in the simulation code XSuite and it is also a promising method both for Slow Extraction at the NIMMS Group and for other users of the Xsuite community. A class in Xsuite was created, which tracks a beam through the Helium Synchrotron, which is simplified to a .json sequence line. A Beam Interact function was used to calculate the number of particles extracted per window (defined by the electrostatic septum), and fed this into the controller’s class. The controller’s class gets the beam data from Helium Synchrotron and passes them to the controller that calculates the necessary voltage kick and then applies this kick to the current beam. The tool’s primary purpose is to facilitate control over the extraction process at the Helium Synchrotron, accommodating various factors such as the number of particles, emittance, sextupole strength, and tune distance. Previously, each RF-KO necessitated manual optimization based on an eight-variable function.},

The lack of magnetic shims in the model is a limitation in describing the operational beam, which will be addressed by adding shim geometries to the model. This work provides the backbone to fully describe the optics from the PS to the East Area, taking into account the non-linear behaviour of the stray fields. This will allow for the design of the transfer line modification necessary to deliver the beam sizes needed for CHIMERA as well as the study of the implementation of octupoles to fold the phase space and produce a uniform beam suitable for sample irradiation [15].},

The required (micro-) electronics reliability assurance testing conditions can be met by using 100 MeV/n - 5 GeV/n Pb ion beams extracted from CERN’s Proton Synchrotron (PS) which have a surface Linear Energy Transfer (LET) range of 10-40 MeV cm2/mg, {\textgreater}1 mm penetration depth in silicon and several cm FWHM beam size. This paper gathers the results from Monte Carlo simulations in FLUKA which were used to understand the transport of ions through the T08 transfer line in the PS East Area, focusing on key effects such as energy straggling, loss of transmission (e.g. through scattering and nuclear fragmentation) and beam size. These calculations served as input for machine development activities and allow us to characterize the radiation field at the testing location, in present and future experimental configurations.

	abstract = {Xsuite is a newly developed modular simulation package combining in a single flexible and modern framework the capabilities of different tools developed at CERN in the past decades, notably Sixtrack, Sixtracklib, COMBI and PyHEADTAIL. The suite consists of a set of Python modules (Xobjects, Xpart, Xtrack, Xcoll, Xfields, Xdeps) that can be flexibly combined together and with other accelerator-specific and general-purpose python tools to study complex simulation scenarios. The code allows for symplectic modeling of the particle dynamics, combined with the effect of synchrotron radiation, impedances, feedbacks, space charge, electron cloud, beam-beam, beamstrahlung, and electron lenses. For collimation studies, beam-matter interaction is simulated using the K2 scattering model or interfacing Xsuite with the BDSIM/Geant4 library. Tools are available to compute the accelerator optics functions from the tracking model and to generate particle distributions matched to the optics. Different computing platforms are supported, including conventional CPUs, as well as GPUs from different vendors.},

	title = {Study and development of {SPS} slow extraction schemes and focusing of secondary particles for the {ENUBET} monitored neutrino beam},
	url = {https://cds.cern.ch/record/2850459},
	abstract = {The Enhanced NeUtrino BEams from Kaon Tagging (ENUBET) project aims at developing a first \&quot;monitored\&quot; neutrino beam, in which the neutrino flux could be measured with a {\textasciitilde}1\% precision. To do so, the secondary particles decay tunnel will be fully instrumented with compact segmented calorimeters, with the goal of tagging each Ke3 decay of kaons. As a consequence of this, a high precision measurement of the electron neutrino cross-section could be performed, since the uncertainty on the neutrino flux represents the current main limitation. A full instrumentation of the decay tunnel significantly influences the requirements on the extraction of the primary protons. The pile-up in the detectors rules out the fast-extraction scheme, and calls for the use of the slow resonant extraction, in which continuous spills of the length of several seconds are extracted from the accelerator. Such a long spill would require the use of static focusing devices on the beamline. However, given the low number of produced electron neutrinos, speeding up the cross-section measurement by resorting to a magnetic horn for improved focusing represents an appealing idea. This would require to modify the slow extraction scheme in order to produce a new \&quot;pulsed\&quot; version of it, with pulse lengths of the order of some millisecond. In the present work, such a pulsed slow extraction scheme is designed, implemented, and tested at CERN-SPS, with the goal of proving its feasibility according to the requirements of ENUBET. The obtained experimental results are validated with simulations and future possible improvements are investigated. In connection to this, a dedicated study on the frequency response to magnet ripples of the slow extraction process is undertaken: this problem is strictly connected with the performance of the pulsed slow extraction, and can also significantly contribute to improve the standard continuous-spill operation of the experiment (and any other fixed target facility). Both measurements and simulations are used to characterize the process and propose meaningful improvements. Finally, a framework for the simulation and optimization of the ENUBET magnetic horn is developed. This is used to start the investigation of the potential flux gain which could come from the use of the magnetic horn in the ENUBET beamline, coupled with the pulsed slow extraction.},

The requirements overlap with fundamental physics experimental requests that are being studied at CERN, albeit at very different energy scales. In this contribution, a scheme for extracting millisecond bursts from synchrotrons is explored by controlling a third-integer resonant and chromatic extraction with RF phase displacement acceleration. The scheme would be implementable in existing medical and experimental synchrotron facilities. Using a model of the CERN Proton Synchrotron, both single-burst and multi-burst extractions are simulated. Results show that 80 − 90 \% of the total beam intensity is extracted in a single burst of 40 − 60 ms. This would correspond to a ∼10 ms burst in a typical medical synchrotron, namely the one outlined in the Proton Ion Medical Machine Study. A set of 3 consecutive bursts of 30 ms was simulated in the Proton Synchrotron with optimised machine parameters.},

For this purpose, a scheme with a simple model of the extraction process has been proposed. Using this simple model, an analysis was carried out for determining the parameter relevant to the diffusion process in the separatrix. With this parameter, the new AM function obtained by the analytical approach could provide a flat spill within ±23\% in both a simulation and an experiment at the HIMAC synchrotron.

	abstract = {We investigate the potential of applying a state-of-the-art, local derivative-free solver, Py-BOBYQA to global optimization problems. In particular, we demonstrate the potential of a restarts procedure – as distinct from multistart methods – to allow Py-BOBYQA to escape local minima (where ordinarily it would terminate at the first local minimum found). We also introduce an adaptive variant of restarts which yields improved performance on global optimization problems. As Py-BOBYQA is a model-based trust-region method, we compare largely with other global optimization methods for which (global) models are important, such as Bayesian optimization and response surface methods; we also consider state-of-the-art representative deterministic and stochastic codes, such as DIRECT and CMA-ES. We find numerically that the restarts procedures in Py-BOBYQA are effective at helping it to escape local minima, when compared to using no restarts in Py-BOBYQA. Additionally, we find that Py-BOBYQA with adaptive restarts has comparable performance with global optimization solvers for all accuracy/budget regimes, in both smooth and noisy settings. In particular, Py-BOBYQA variants are best performing for smooth and multiplicative noise problems in high-accuracy regimes. As a by-product, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn on the relative performance of the global solvers we have tested with default settings.},

	abstract = {We present two software packages for derivative-free optimization (DFO): DFO-LS for nonlinear least-squares problems and Py-BOBYQA for general objectives, both with optional bound constraints. Inspired by the Gauss-Newton method, DFO-LS constructs simplified linear regression models for the residuals and allows flexible initialization for expensive problems, whereby it can begin making progress after as few as two objective evaluations. Numerical results show DFO-LS can gain reasonable progress on some medium-scale problems with fewer objective evaluations than is needed for one gradient evaluation. DFO-LS has improved robustness to noise, allowing sample averaging, regression-based model construction, and multiple restart strategies with an auto-detection mechanism. Our extensive numerical experimentation shows that restarting the solver when stagnation is detected is a cheap and effective mechanism for achieving robustness, with superior performance over sampling and regression techniques. The package Py-BOBYQA is a Python implementation of BOBYQA (Powell 2009), with novel features such as the implementation of robustness to noise strategies. Our numerical experiments show that Py-BOBYQA is comparable to or better than existing general DFO solvers for noisy problems. In our comparisons, we introduce an adaptive accuracy measure for data profiles of noisy functions, striking a balance between measuring the true and the noisy objective improvement.},

I have taken a sampling of different ion species and energies from past running periods.
There are some slight variations that are dependent upon the species, but in almost all measures, the flux uniformity is independent of species and energy.
I looked at situations where the flux (ions/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill) was high enough so that statistical fluctuation could be neglected.
When running at an average flux of 64000 ions/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill of Iodine @ 473 MeV/n, the RMS deviation observed was 3489 ions/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill, or {\textasciitilde}5.4\%.
Comparing to another day when we ran at {\textasciitilde}8000 ions/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill, the RMS was 7.1\%.
These are fairly typical numbers for our electronics testing program.
 
We have several “knobs” to control flux.
When taking beam from the EBIS, we usually begin by defocusing the beam at the entrance to the Booster synchrotron so that only a small fraction of the ion source beam makes it into the Booster acceptance.
When using the Tandem van de Graaff as the ion source, we narrow down the timing of the Tandem chopper which allows only a small fraction of the Tandem beam to be injected into the Booster.
When using the LINAC for protons, we have a similar chopper that cuts back on LINAC output.  The LINAC also has an Einzel Lens that can defocus the beam to the Booster.
Each of these techniques can reduce the flux by about 2 orders of magnitude into the Booster.  When it is reduced by more than that, the beam becomes hard to monitor and control in the Booster.
After extraction, the NSRL beamline makes use of a Platinum collimator, a set of two jaws that pinch off the aperture of the extracted beam.  These collimators can be effectively closed, reducing the flux to nearly zero.   
Each of these flux reduction mechanisms can change the shape of the beam spot, spoiling the spatial uniformity.  Care must be taken to understand the effect before applying it.  
We often get requests to vary the flux from peak values (1E8 protons/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill, 1E6 Fe/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill, 1E5 Au/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill) down to single digits of ions, 10 to 100 is not uncommon.  We are currently running at {\textasciitilde}100 Carbon ions/cm{\textasciicircum}2/spill.

The range of the particles in tissue is controlled by the variation of the beam energy in the accelerator. Computer simulations were used to compare a discrete scan mode (pixel scan) with a continous scan mode (raster scan). It was found that both methods lead to nearly identical results. The design and technical realization of the magnetic scanning system at GSI combines features of both scan techniques.

	abstract = {The space radiation environment can lead to extremely harsh operating conditions for on-board electronic box and systems. The characteristics of the radiation environment are highly dependent on the type of mission (date, duration and orbit). Radiation accelerates the aging of the electronic parts and material and can lead to a degradation of electrical performance; it can also create transient phenomena on parts. Such damage at the part level can induce damage or functional failure at electronic box, subsystem, and system levels. A rigorous methodology is needed to ensure that the radiation environment does not compromise the functionality and performance of the electronics during the system life. This methodology is called hardness assurance. It consists of those activities undertaken to ensure that the electronic piece parts placed in the space system perform to their design specifications after exposure to the space environment. It deals with system requirements, environmental definitions, part selection, part testing, shielding and radiation tolerant design. All these elements should play together in order to produce a system tolerant to.the radiation environment. An overview of the different steps of a space system hardness assurance program is given in section 2. In order to define the mission radiation specifications and compare these requirements to radiation test data, a detailed knowledge of the space environment and the corresponding electronic device failure mechanisms is required. The presentation by J. Mazur deals with the Earth space radiation environment as well as the internal environment of a spacecraft. The presentation by J. Schwank deals with ionization effects, and the presentation by T. Weatherford deals with Single particle Event Phenomena (SEP) in semiconductor devices and microcircuits. These three presentations provide more detailed background to complement the sections 3 and 4. Part selection and categorization are discussed in section 5. Section 6 presents the organization of the hardness assurance within a project. Section 7 discusses emerging radiation hardness assurance issues.},

	abstract = {The East Area renovation will cover the refurbishment of the East Hall with its beamlines and infrastructures. A re-design of the beamlines is included to improve the magnet situation, the radiation situation, and maintainability in general. Thanks to a cycled powering mode of the magnets instead of a steady state one, considerable energy savings will be possible. Therefore, several magnet families have to be re-designed to be in accordance with the purposes of the project. 
The new East Area magnet system consists of 12 different designs with a total of 58 magnets among which 15 are bending magnets, 31 are quadrupoles, and 12 are correctors. In the Proton Synchrotron (PS) area (Building 352), the primary area (Building 157), and the line T08 (Building 157), the magnets will be cycled every 2.4 s. This concerns the lines F61, F62, part of F63, and T08. The other lines, T09, T10, and T11, will be cycled with a period of 4.8 s. Cycling the magnets is an important constraint for the construction of the magnetic parts (yokes). In addition, the coils have to be adapted to match the power supply specifications. The magnets have to be laminated to avoid eddy currents and large delays between the magnetic field and the current application. All laminated magnets currently used and needed in the new in the East Area layout will be refurbished, this concerns four families (or 22 units). The new magnets will be manufactured by industry according to CERN’s design. 
Another constraint is the magnet overall size limitations. As the layout was fixed at the beginning of the project, all new large magnet designs had to have the same length and width as the present ones. This complicates the designs, as laminated yokes need a larger mechanical structure around the yoke to maintain the laminations. The total lengths and widths have been discussed with the integration team and after few iterations a solution was found and the final designs approved.},

The roof is 21.8 m high at the central point above a skylight running longitudinally down its centre; it has a slope of 20\% running down to the longitudinal façade summits at 15.6 m. The roof is 47.4 m wide as the longitudinal façades include wings protruding 2.2 m from a height of 7.5 m to the summits, running the entire length of the building. The longitudinal façades are made up of a variety of materials (masonry, wood agglomerate, fibro-cement, and glass). The end walls are made of reinforced concrete (Northwest wall) or wood agglomerate (Southeast wall). 



The East Hall is now 55 years old and many facets of the building envelope are in an unacceptable state. There are dilapidated and unsafe materials forming and falling from the envelope of the building. The uninsulated envelope does not conform to current building energy-management requirements, resulting in disproportional thermal losses and hence financial losses due to heating requirements. 
The envelope renovation project has two principal objectives with a number of specific objectives. 
– ‘To improve the safety and comfort in the building by replacing the existing envelope’. 








Removing the dilapidate asbestos-containing ceiling panels.
Removing existing poorly fixed, single-glazed windows with asbestos containing joints.
Removing existing uninsulated fibro-cement façade panels.
Eradicating the water infiltrations coming from the roof. 

– To ensure a synergy with the consolidation of the façade of the attached Building 156. 
As such, the entire envelope was studied in an attempt to create a safe environment, optimizing energy savings, responding to modern building codes, and respect an aesthetic liaison with Building 156.

	abstract = {The PS primary proton beam is slowly extracted at 24 GeV/c towards the East Area with the help of the third- order resonance technique over a typical spill length of 350 to 450 ns within 2.4 s cycles. The number of East Area extractions is usually around five to six per overall PS super-cycle of typically 40 s and depends on both users and schedule constraints, respectively. After passing both magnetic septa SMH57 and SMH61 in the PS, the beam enters the F61 transfer line that transports the beam either to the so-called North Targets via the lines F62 and F63 or towards T08, which serves the irradiation facilities IRRAD and CHARM. During operation of primary ion beams, only these irradiation facilities can be operated. The principle of extraction by third-order resonance and the corresponding optical elements inside the PS, such as the magnetic septa, will be kept unchanged for the new East Area operation. Thus, only a replacement of the existing magnets by laminated versions with slight optimization of the optics was chosen as the renovation baseline for F61 with changes in the layout mostly due to integration constraints and considerations for improved radiation protection. In particular, all the main horizontal bends have been replaced by reliable and robust MCB magnets, which are available with sufficient spares and can be operated in pulsed mode. The splitting option, although more efficient for operation, was dropped in 2005 for technical reasons that were hard to overcome in a reliable manner.

	abstract = {A beam extraction method using a transverse rf electric field with amplitude and frequency modulation has been studied in order to develop an irradiation method which is synchronized with the breathing of a patient for high-quality charged particle therapy. The dependence of the extracted beam intensity on the voltage, the frequency band width and the center frequency of the transverse rf electric field has been investigated. The extracted beam intensity was slightly increased from that of the ordinary slow extraction method with a third order resonance. The response of the extracted beam intensity to the applied transverse rf electric field was as prompt as within 1 ms. The horizontal emittance of beams extracted by the present method was reduced by about 70\% compared with that by the ordinary one due to utilizing a constant separatrix. Amplitude modulation can control the global beam spill structure. The frequency modulation reduced the effect of the current ripple of the main quadrupole magnets.},

The simulation demonstrates that the tune ripple influences the beam spill in two ways. On the one hand, the tune ripple causes a direct fluctuation in the separatrix area, which induces beam spill ripple. On the other hand, the tune ripple influences the emittance growth rate in RF-knockout slow extraction. These two aspects simultaneously contribute to the beam spill ripple.},

	abstract = {The NASA SPACE RADIATION LABORATORY (NSRL) has been constructed and started operations at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 2003. The NSRL facility will be used by NASA to conduct radiation effect studies on materials and biological samples for the space program. The NSRL facility utilizes proton and heavy-ion beams of energies from 50 to 3000 MeV/n which are accelerated by the AGS\_Booster synchrotron accelerator. To date, protons, 12C, 56Fe, 48Ti ion beams of various magnetic rigidities have been transported to the sample location which is located 100 m downstream from the beginning of the NSRL line. The NSRL beam transport line has been designed to employ octupole magnetic elements[1] which transform the normal (Gaussian) beam distribution at the location of the sample into a beam with rectangular cross section, and uniformly distributed over the rectangle. To obtain the uniform beam distribution on the sample, no beam-collimation is applied at any location along the NSRL beam transport line and the beam focusing at the location of the sample is purely magnetic. In this technical note we present data from the beam distribution at the target when the octupoles are excited, and compare the beam distributions with octupoles turned off, and the effects of beam misalignments on the beam uniformity at the target will be discussed along with the correction methods used. Future developments on obtaining uniform beams will also be discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            GaToroid is a concept of toroidal gantry for hadron therapy under investigation at CERN It makes use of the toroidal magnetic field between each pair of coils to steer and focus the particle beams down to the patient. This peculiar concept requires detailed studies on particle tracking and beam optics to optimise the winding geometry and explore the properties of the system. The work presented in this manuscript is focused on the features of a GaToroid system for protons, specifically designed to minimise the footprint and weight of the gantry. Firstly, a two-dimensional single particle tracking was developed to optimise the coil geometry and the toroidal magnetic field, aiming to the maximisation of the energy acceptance of the magnet. Particles over the whole spectrum of treatment energy are directed at isocenter within 1 mm of precision. This procedure, restricted to the symmetry plane between each pair of coils, defines different beam orbits, function of the beam energy. Subsequently, a three-dimensional particle tracking was implemented to evaluate the interaction of a beam of finite dimensions with the complete magnetic field map in vacuum. The parameters of the simulated beam at the isocenter are coherent with the clinical requirements. The results of the three-dimensional tracking were then used to calculate the linear transfer matrix associated to each beam orbit. Finally, the option of performing the beam spot scanning at the isocenter by acting on the upstream steering magnet has been investigated, highlighting the potential of the concept, as well as the limitations related to the scanning field dimension and source-to-axis distance. In conclusion, the results described in this paper represent a crucial step toward the understanding of the beam optics properties of a GaToroid gantry.},

Specifically, the outcomes of the first UHE heavy ion test campaign carried out at the CHARM facility are presented and discussed in this contribution. UHE ion beams have the advantage of not requiring a previous modification of the samples or testing in vacuum, owing to their large penetration range. The unique nature of the UHE ions motivated the study of their interaction with matter, with regard to the induction of SEE. To that end, great effort was paid on the calibration of the beam line instrumentation, typically prepared for the traditional proton runs. Electronic components sensitive to single event upset (SEU) and single-event latchup (SEL) were irradiated by an UHE xenon beam, with a particular interest in studying the sub-LET cross section region and benchmarking against the standard heavy ion test beams. Finally, the suitability of UHE ion testing for Radiation Hardness Assurance is also discussed in the contribution.},

Despite their capability of providing a broad range of linear energy transfer (LET) values, the main limitations are related to the need of testing in a vacuum and with the sensitive region of the components accessible to the low range ions. In this paper, we explore the use of ultrahigh energy (UHE) (5-150 GeV/n) ions in the CERN accelerator complex for radiation effects on electronics testing. At these energies, we show, both through simulations and experimental data, the significant impact of the ion energy on the ionization track structure and associated volume-restricted LET value, highlighting the possible limitations for radiation hardness assurance for high-energy accelerator applications. In addition, we show that from a nuclear interaction perspective, UHE ions behave similar to protons independently of their significantly larger mass.},

For that purpose, field maps of the magnet have been measured for the various operational current settings. They include the central field, the end stray field and the lateral stray field. In order to get a functional form which can be inserted in the equations of motion for a charged particle in a magnetic field, the discrete field maps are converted into bi-dimensional polynomials of degree up to fourteen. These equations can be written as a set of four first order differential equations which are solved simultaneously. Two of them are non-linear and describe the centroid motion, the other two are linear and apply to the betatron motion. The method has been validated by producing extraction conditions which have been verified experimentally with the 26 GeV/c beam for the future LHC.},

For that reason, the measured field map at 26 GeV/c of the CPS magnets has been converted into a two-dimensional polynomial to get a functional form appropriate for subsequent beam trajectory computations. Effects of magnet shimming, not considered during the magnetic measurements, and changes in the currents of the pole-face windings have been examined, and the field map has been adjusted accordingly by means of calculations with the program Poisson. The equation of the beam trajectory and the transfer matrices through the field map have been derived to yield an accurate knowledge of the optical parameters at ejection, and thus in the transfer channel between the CPS and the SPS machines.

	abstract = {The CERN Proton Synchrotron machine is built using combined function magnets. The control of the linear tune as well as the chromaticity in both planes is achieved by means of special coils added to the main magnets, namely two pole-face-windings and one ﬁgure-of-eight loop. As a result, the overall magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is rather complex not to mention the saturation effects induced at top-energy. For these reasons a linear model of the PS main magnet does not provide sufﬁcient precision to model particle dynamics. On the other hand, a sophisticated optical model is the key element for the foreseen intensity upgrade and, in particular, for the novel extraction mode based on adiabatic capture of beam particles inside stable islands in transverse phase space. A solution was found by performing accurate measurement of the nonlinear tune as a function of both amplitude and momentum offset so to extract both linear and nonlinear properties of the lattice. In this paper the measurement results are presented and the derived optical model is discussed in detail.},

This method [N. Tsoupas et al., Nucl. Sci. Eng. 126, 71 (1997)] of generating uniform beam distributions on a plane normal to the beam’s direction relies only on magnetically focusing the transported beam; no collimation of the beam is required or any other type of interaction of the beam with materials other than the target material. The method compares favorably with alternative methods of producing such distributions, and it can be applied to the entire energy spectrum of charged particle beams that are delivered to the NSRL’s experiments by the Booster for the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at BNL.},

	abstract = {FASER is a proposed small and inexpensive experiment designed to search for light, weakly-interacting particles during Run 3 of the LHC from 2021-23. Such particles may be produced in large numbers along the beam collision axis, travel for hundreds of meters without interacting, and then decay to standard model particles. To search for such events, FASER will be located 480 m downstream of the ATLAS IP in the unused service tunnel TI12 and be sensitive to particles that decay in a cylindrical volume with radius R=10 cm and length L=1.5 m. FASER will complement the LHC's existing physics program, extending its discovery potential to a host of new, light particles, with potentially far-reaching implications for particle physics and cosmology. This document describes the technical details of the FASER detector components: the magnets, the tracker, the scintillator system, and the calorimeter, as well as the trigger and readout system. The preparatory work that is needed to install and operate the detector, including civil engineering, transport, and integration with various services is also presented. The information presented includes preliminary cost estimates for the detector components and the infrastructure work, as well as a timeline for the design, construction, and installation of the experiment.},

	abstract = {FASER is a proposed small and inexpensive experiment designed to search for light, weakly-interacting particles at the LHC. Such particles are dominantly produced along the beam collision axis and may be long-lived, traveling hundreds of meters before decaying. To exploit both of these properties, FASER is to be located along the beam collision axis, 480 m downstream from the ATLAS interaction point, in the unused service tunnel TI18. We propose that FASER be installed in TI18 in Long Shutdown 2 in time to collect data from 2021-23 during Run 3 of the 14 TeV LHC. FASER will detect new particles that decay within a cylindrical volume with radius R= 10 cm and length L = 1.5 m. With these small dimensions, FASER will complement the LHC's existing physics program, extending its discovery potential to a host of new particles, including dark photons, axion-like particles, and other CP-odd scalars. A FLUKA simulation and analytical estimates have confirmed that numerous potential backgrounds are highly suppressed at the FASER location, and the first in situ measurements are currently underway. We describe FASER's location and discovery potential, its target signals and backgrounds, the detector's layout and components, and the experiment's preliminary cost estimate, funding, and timeline.},

	abstract = {The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, and not including the gravitational force) in the universe, as well as classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world,  with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks.  Since then, confirmation of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.
Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated huge successes in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the Universe as possibly described by dark energy.  The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.
The development of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory, which exhibits a wide range of phenomena including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, ﬁgures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Uniﬁed Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology. Starting with this edition, the Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and all review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings. Review articles that were previously part of the Listings are now included in volume 1. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, ﬁgures, and equations from selected review articles is also available.},

The particles created in this process (the final state) must each be less massive than the original, although the total invariant mass of the system must be conserved. A particle is unstable if there is at least one allowed final state that it can decay into. Unstable particles will often have multiple ways of decaying, each with its own associated probability. Decays are mediated by one or several fundamental forces. The particles in the final state may themselves be unstable and subject to further decay.
The term is typically distinct from radioactive decay, in which an unstable atomic nucleus is transformed into a lighter nucleus accompanied by the emission of particles or radiation, although the two are conceptually similar and are often described using the same terminology.},

The effect was discovered by John C. Mallinson in 1973, and these "one-sided flux" structures were initially described by him as a "curiosity", although at the time he recognized from this discovery the potential for significant improvements in magnetic tape technology.Physicist Klaus Halbach, while at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory during the 1980s, independently invented the Halbach array to focus particle accelerator beams.},

	title = {{FASER}: {CERN} approves new experiment to look for long-lived, exotic particles},
	shorttitle = {{FASER}},
	url = {https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/faser-cern-approves-new-experiment-look-long-lived-exotic-particles},
	abstract = {Geneva. Today, the CERN Research Board approved a new experiment designed to look for light and weakly interacting particles at the LHC. FASER, or the Forward Search Experiment, will complement CERN’s ongoing physics programme, extending its discovery potential to several new particles. Some of these sought-after particles are associated with dark matter, which is a hypothesised kind of matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic force and consequently cannot be directly detected using emitted light. Astrophysical evidence shows that dark matter makes up about 27\% of the universe, but it has never been observed and studied in a laboratory.

With an expanding interest in undiscovered particles, particularly long-lived particles and dark matter, new experiments have been proposed to expand the scientific potential of CERN’s accelerator complex and infrastructure as part of the Physics Beyond Collider (PBC) study, under whose aegis FASER operates. “This novel experiment helps diversify the physics programme of colliders such as the LHC, and allows us to address unanswered questions in particle physics from a different perspective,” explains Mike Lamont, co-coordinator of the PBC study group.

The four main LHC detectors are not suited for detecting the light and weakly interacting particles that might be produced parallel to the beam line. They may travel hundreds of metres without interacting with any material before transforming into known and detectable particles, such as electrons and positrons. The exotic particles would escape the existing detectors along the current beam lines and remain undetected. FASER will therefore be located along the beam trajectory 480 metres downstream from the interaction point within ATLAS. Although the protons in the particle beams will be bent by magnets around the LHC, the light, very weakly interacting particles will continue along a straight line and their “decay products” can be spotted by FASER. The potential new particles would be very collimated with the beam, spreading out very little, therefore allowing a relatively small and inexpensive detector to perform highly sensitive searches.

The detector’s total length is under 5 metres and its core cylindrical structure has a radius of 10 centimetres. It will be installed in a side tunnel along an unused transfer line which links the LHC to its injector, the Super Proton Synchrotron. To allow FASER to be constructed in a quick and affordable way, it will use spare detector parts kindly donated from the ATLAS and LHCb experiments. The collaboration of 16 institutes that is building the detector and will carry out the experiments is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation and the Simons Foundation.

FASER will search for a suite of hypothesised particles including so-called “dark photons”, particles which are associated with dark matter, neutralinos and others. The experiment will be installed during the ongoing Long Shutdown 2 and start taking data from LHC’s Run 3 between 2021 and 2023.

“It is very exciting to have FASER approved for installation at CERN. It is amazing how the collaboration has come together so quickly and we are looking forward to recording our first data when the LHC starts up again in 2021,” says Jamie Boyd, co-spokesperson of the FASER experiment.

“FASER is a neat physics proposal that addresses a particular aspect in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model and I am pleased to see it being implemented so efficiently,” adds Eckhard Elsen, CERN’s Director for Research and Computing.},

	abstract = {Concentrates have advantages of high ferrous grade, less harmful impurities and lower price. However, the small size and poor granulation behavior of concentrates could deteriorate the permeability of the sinter bed and reduce sinter productivity, thus making it difficult to use concentrates effectively. Therefore, in order to strengthen the granulation behavior of concentrates, granulation experiments were carried out and experiment samples made with one kind of concentrates and five kinds of fine iron ores were produced in this paper. Then, the effects of water absorbility and wettability of fine iron ores on granulation behavior of concentrates were investigated. Furthermore, optimized ore blending recipes were proposed to strengthen the granulation behavior of concentrates by sinter pot tests. Results show that the granulation behavior of concentrates was improved for the samples exhibiting high maximum capillary water and small contact angle in fine iron ores. Compared with the scheme of blending ores containing 15 mass\% concentrate, the growth index of quasi-particles increased by 20.62\% in the case of iron ore BR-2 replacing half of iron ore BR-1, the vertical sintering speed went up from 26.32 to 29.26 mm min{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, the productivity increased from 1.95 to 2.20 t m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. The growth index of the quasi-particles increased by 30\% when using iron ore AR-2 to replace half of iron ore AR-1.

The results help to improve the granulation behavior of concentrates by optimizing the blending ore recipes, based on the characteristics of fine iron ores, and thus use these concentrates more efficiently in the sintering process.},

	abstract = {Bremsstrahlung (German pronunciation: [ˈbʁɛmsˌʃtʁaːlʊŋ] ( listen)), from bremsen "to brake" and Strahlung "radiation"; i.e., "braking radiation" or "deceleration radiation", is electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus. The moving particle loses kinetic energy, which is converted into radiation, i.e. a photon, thus satisfying the law of conservation of energy. The term is also used to refer to the process of producing the radiation. Bremsstrahlung has a continuous spectrum, which becomes more intense and whose peak intensity shifts toward higher frequencies as the change of the energy of the decelerated particles increases.
Broadly speaking, bremsstrahlung or braking radiation is any radiation produced due to the deceleration (negative acceleration) of a charged particle, which includes synchrotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a relativistic particle), cyclotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a non-relativistic particle), and the emission of electrons and positrons during beta decay. However, the term is frequently used in the more narrow sense of radiation from electrons (from whatever source) slowing in matter.
Bremsstrahlung emitted from plasma is sometimes referred to as free/free radiation. This refers to the fact that the radiation in this case is created by charged particles that are free; i.e., not part of an ion, atom or molecule, both before and after the deflection (acceleration) that caused the emission.},

	abstract = {Antimatter nuclei in cosmic rays (CR) represent a promising discovery channel for the indirect search of dark matter. We present astrophysical background calculations of CR antideuteron (\${\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\$) and antihelium (\${\textbackslash}overline\{He\}\$). These particles are produced by high-energy collisions of CR protons and nuclei with the gas nuclei of the interstellar medium. In our calculations, we also consider production and shock acceleration of antinuclei in the shells of supernova remnants (SNRs). The total flux of \${\textbackslash}overline\{d\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}overline\{He\}\$ particles is constrained using new AMS measurements on the boron/carbon (B/C) and antiproton/proton (\${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}/p\$) ratios. The two ratios leads to different antiparticle fluxes in the high-energy regime \$E{\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ 10 GeV/n where, in particular, \${\textbackslash}bar\{p\}/p\$-driven calculations leads to a significantly larger antiparticle flux in comparison to predictions from conventional B/C-driven constraints. On the other hand, both approaches provide consistent results in the sub-GeV/n energy window, which is where dark matter induced signal may exceed the astrophysical background. In this region, the total antinuclei flux, from interaction in the insterstellar gas and inside SNRs, is tightly bounded by the data. Shock-acceleration of antiparticles in SNRs has a minor influence in the astrophysical background for dark matter searches.},

	abstract = {A polarized 3D system uses polarization glasses to create the illusion of three-dimensional images by restricting the light that reaches each eye (an example of stereoscopy).
To present stereoscopic images and films, two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen or display through different polarizing filters. The viewer wears low-cost eyeglasses which contain a pair of different polarizing filters. As each filter passes only that light which is similarly polarized and blocks the light polarized in the opposite direction, each eye sees a different image. This is used to produce a three-dimensional effect by projecting the same scene into both eyes, but depicted from slightly different perspectives. Multiple people can view the stereoscopic images at the same time.},

	abstract = {Sir Isaac Newton (; 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author and physicist (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made pathbreaking contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus. Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the Solar System and demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's theoretical prediction that the Earth is shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, thus convincing most Continental European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over the earlier system of Descartes. Newton also built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. Newton's work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, first published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves. Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian, who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and who, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and he spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1700) and Master (1700–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).},
