	abstract = {Perturbation of a beam by an obstacle in the beam patch is a well-known problem. Monitoring devices to determine beam parameters or stripping foils to change the charge state of ions are placed in the beam path and cause energy loss and scattering processes. This note describes these processes in the framework of covariance matrices, which makes no a priori assumption of the actual phase space distribution and is applicable to a variety of processes involving changes in particle position and angle. Exact compact expressions are derived whose series expansions yield the usual approximate expressions for increase in beam emittance and change in Twiss parrameters. A numerical example is given fo the case of scattering and compared with results derived from a corresponding Monte Carlo calculation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the potential of applying a state-of-the-art, local derivative-free solver, Py-BOBYQA to global optimization problems. In particular, we demonstrate the potential of a restarts procedure – as distinct from multistart methods – to allow Py-BOBYQA to escape local minima (where ordinarily it would terminate at the first local minimum found). We also introduce an adaptive variant of restarts which yields improved performance on global optimization problems. As Py-BOBYQA is a model-based trust-region method, we compare largely with other global optimization methods for which (global) models are important, such as Bayesian optimization and response surface methods; we also consider state-of-the-art representative deterministic and stochastic codes, such as DIRECT and CMA-ES. We find numerically that the restarts procedures in Py-BOBYQA are effective at helping it to escape local minima, when compared to using no restarts in Py-BOBYQA. Additionally, we find that Py-BOBYQA with adaptive restarts has comparable performance with global optimization solvers for all accuracy/budget regimes, in both smooth and noisy settings. In particular, Py-BOBYQA variants are best performing for smooth and multiplicative noise problems in high-accuracy regimes. As a by-product, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn on the relative performance of the global solvers we have tested with default settings.},

	abstract = {We present two software packages for derivative-free optimization (DFO): DFO-LS for nonlinear least-squares problems and Py-BOBYQA for general objectives, both with optional bound constraints. Inspired by the Gauss-Newton method, DFO-LS constructs simplified linear regression models for the residuals and allows flexible initialization for expensive problems, whereby it can begin making progress after as few as two objective evaluations. Numerical results show DFO-LS can gain reasonable progress on some medium-scale problems with fewer objective evaluations than is needed for one gradient evaluation. DFO-LS has improved robustness to noise, allowing sample averaging, regression-based model construction, and multiple restart strategies with an auto-detection mechanism. Our extensive numerical experimentation shows that restarting the solver when stagnation is detected is a cheap and effective mechanism for achieving robustness, with superior performance over sampling and regression techniques. The package Py-BOBYQA is a Python implementation of BOBYQA (Powell 2009), with novel features such as the implementation of robustness to noise strategies. Our numerical experiments show that Py-BOBYQA is comparable to or better than existing general DFO solvers for noisy problems. In our comparisons, we introduce an adaptive accuracy measure for data profiles of noisy functions, striking a balance between measuring the true and the noisy objective improvement.},
