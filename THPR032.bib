  abstract     = {{Xsuite is a newly developed modular simulation package combining in a single flexible and modern framework the capabilities of different tools developed at CERN in the past decades, notably Sixtrack, Sixtracklib, COMBI and PyHEADTAIL. The suite is made of a set of python modules (Xobjects, Xparts, Xtrack, Xcoll, Xfields, Xdpes) that can be flexibly combined together and with other accelerator-specific and general-purpose python tools to study complex simulation scenarios. The code allows for symplectic modeling of the particle dynamics, combined with the effect of synchrotron radiation, impedances, feedbacks, space charge, electron cloud, beam-beam, beamstrahlung, electron lenses. For collimation studies, beam-matter interaction is simulated using the K2 scattering model or interfacing Xsuite with the BDSIM/Geant4 library. Tools are available to compute the accelerator optics functions from the tracking model and to generate particle distributions matched to the optics. Different computing platforms are supported, including conventional CPUs, as well as GPUs from different vendors.}},

A variety of methods for the manipulation of particle beam properties are also presented, for instance, bunch length and energy compression, bunch rotation, changes to the damping partition number, and beam collimation. The different procedures are illustrated by examples from various accelerators. Special topics include injection and extraction methods, beam cooling, spin transport and polarization.},

  abstract = {The East Area renovation will cover the refurbishment of the East Hall with its beamlines and infrastructures. A re-design of the beamlines is included to improve the magnet situation, the radiation situation, and maintainability in general. Thanks to a cycled powering mode of the magnets instead of a steady state one, considerable energy savings will be possible. Therefore, several magnet families have to be re-designed to be in accordance with the purposes of the project.  The new East Area magnet system consists of 12 different designs with a total of 58 magnets among which 15 are bending magnets, 31 are quadrupoles, and 12 are correctors. In the Proton Synchrotron (PS) area (Building 352), the primary area (Building 157), and the line T08 (Building 157), the magnets will be cycled every 2.4 s. This concerns the lines F61, F62, part of F63, and T08. The other lines, T09, T10, and T11, will be cycled with a period of 4.8 s. Cycling the magnets is an important constraint for the construction of the magnetic parts (yokes). In addition, the coils have to be adapted to match the power supply specifications. The magnets have to be laminated to avoid eddy currents and large delays between the magnetic field and the current application. All laminated magnets currently used and needed in the new in the East Area layout will be refurbished, this concerns four families (or 22 units). The new magnets will be manufactured by industry according to CERN’s design.  Another constraint is the magnet overall size limitations. As the layout was fixed at the beginning of the project, all new large magnet designs had to have the same length and width as the present ones. This complicates the designs, as laminated yokes need a larger mechanical structure around the yoke to maintain the laminations. The total lengths and widths have been discussed with the integration team and after few iterations a solution was found and the final designs approved.},

For that reason, the measured field map at 26 GeV/c of the CPS magnets has been converted into a two-dimensional polynomial to get a functional form appropriate for subsequent beam trajectory computations. Effects of magnet shimming, not considered during the magnetic measurements, and changes in the currents of the pole-face windings have been examined, and the field map has been adjusted accordingly by means of calculations with the program Poisson. The equation of the beam trajectory and the transfer matrices through the field map have been derived to yield an accurate knowledge of the optical parameters at ejection, and thus in the transfer channel between the CPS and the SPS machines. Experimental verification of the model has been undertaken with the 26 GeV/c beam for the LHC.},

In particular, we demonstrate the potential of a restarts procedure – as distinct from multistart methods – to allow Py-BOBYQA to escape local minima (where ordinarily it would terminate at the first local minimum found). We also introduce an adaptive variant of restarts which yields improved performance on global optimization problems. As Py-BOBYQA is a model-based trust-region method, we compare largely with other global optimization methods for which (global) models are important, such as Bayesian optimization and response surface methods; we also consider state-of-the-art representative deterministic and stochastic codes, such as DIRECT and CMA-ES. We find numerically that the restarts procedures in Py-BOBYQA are effective at helping it to escape local minima, when compared to using no restarts in Py-BOBYQA. Additionally, we find that Py-BOBYQA with adaptive restarts has comparable performance with global optimization solvers for all accuracy/budget regimes, in both smooth and noisy settings. In particular, Py-BOBYQA variants are best performing for smooth and multiplicative noise problems in high-accuracy regimes. As a by-product, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn on the relative performance of the global solvers we have tested with default settings.},

	abstract = {We present two software packages for derivative-free optimization (DFO): DFO-LS for nonlinear least-squares problems and Py-BOBYQA for general objectives, both with optional bound constraints. Inspired by the Gauss-Newton method, DFO-LS constructs simplified linear regression models for the residuals and allows flexible initialization for expensive problems, whereby it can begin making progress after as few as two objective evaluations. Numerical results show DFO-LS can gain reasonable progress on some medium-scale problems with fewer objective evaluations than is needed for one gradient evaluation. DFO-LS has improved robustness to noise, allowing sample averaging, regression-based model construction, and multiple restart strategies with an auto-detection mechanism. Our extensive numerical experimentation shows that restarting the solver when stagnation is detected is a cheap and effective mechanism for achieving robustness, with superior performance over sampling and regression techniques. The package Py-BOBYQA is a Python implementation of BOBYQA (Powell 2009), with novel features such as the implementation of robustness to noise strategies. Our numerical experiments show that Py-BOBYQA is comparable to or better than existing general DFO solvers for noisy problems. In our comparisons, we introduce an adaptive accuracy measure for data profiles of noisy functions, striking a balance between measuring the true and the noisy objective improvement.},

	abstract = {The capabilities and physics models implemented inside the FLUKA code are briefly described, with emphasis on hadronic interaction. Examples of the performances of the code are presented including basic (thin target) and complex benchmarks, and radiation detector specific applications. In particular the ability of FLUKA in describing existing calorimeter performances and in predicting those of future ones, as well as the use of the code for neutron and mixed field radiation detectors will be demonstrated with several examples.},
